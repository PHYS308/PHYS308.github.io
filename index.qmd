From [xkcd.com](https://xkcd.com/1861/)

## Course Description

An investigation of the basic principles of quantum mechanics in the Schrödinger representation and the application of these principles to tunneling, the harmonic oscillator, and the hydrogen atom. Basic theoretical concepts such as Hermitian operators, Ehrenfest’s theorem, commutation relations, and uncertainty principles are developed as the course proceeds.  

Normally offered every year, fall
